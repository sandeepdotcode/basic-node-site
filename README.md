# Basic Information Site

A basic static HTML server built without using a framework. 

Express version of the app is available in the [express branch](https://github.com/sandeepdotcode/basic-node-site/tree/express)

## What I learned

By  doing this project I learned:
- Building a static html server using Node.js
- Using core Node modules like `http`, `path` & `fs`
- using streams to read data from a file
- using ES6 modules with Node instead of CommonJS

## How to run

Clone this repo and run
```bash
cd basic-info-site && node index.mjs
```
